# Commonly used templates available

Today we've made a few commonly used Vapor templates readily available for you to use. These templates are automatically generated from [Vapor's main template](https://github.com/vapor/template) so that they'll always be up-to-date.  
  
These templates can be cloned and build directly without needing the toolbox, making them great to use as a reference and to get to building quickly.
  
The templates can be found here:  
- [Barebones template](https://github.com/vapor/template-bare)  
- [Template with Fluent and MySQL](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-mysql)  
- [Template with Fluent and PostgreSQL](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-postgres)  
- [Template with Leaf, Fluent and PostgreSQL](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-postgres-leaf)  

Happy coding!
