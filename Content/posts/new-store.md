# Vapor Has a New Store!

Some time ago, Vapor had a merch store to buy t-shirts, stickers and other fun stuff. Unfortunately that store ended up being closed due to provider issues, and it took a long time to get a replacement up and running.

However, we finally have a new store launched! [store.vapor.codes](https://store.vapor.codes) is the new place to get your hands on merch for Vapor. We have t-shirts with the new logo on, fun retro designs, stickers, hoodies, and some other fun stuff. All the proceeds from the store contribute directly to funding development on Vapor, so it's a great way to support the project and get merch. If you want to see other products just let us know!

Speaking of supporting, Vapor has long had an [amazing group of sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/vapor). If you sponsor us on GitHub for $10 a month or more, we will send you a set of stickers to say thank you. If you sponsor us $25 a month or more, you'll also get a t-shirt of your choosing! Existing sponsors have been emailed already and new sponsors will hear from me shortly after their sponsorship.

If you want to sponsor us, you can do so on the [GitHub sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/vapor). We also support sponsorship via [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/vapor) as well.

Thank you for all your support!
