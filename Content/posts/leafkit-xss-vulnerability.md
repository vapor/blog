# LeafKit HTML Escaping Vulnerability

We’ve just released [LeafKit](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit/releases/tag/1.14.1) which fixes a security vulnerability that would allow XSS injection attacks by injecting unicode extended grapheme clusters into Leaf templates. Using a grapheme cluster such as `"́` would bypass escaping, since Swift treats that as a single character and different to `"`. This caused the escaping function to skip it.
HTML on the other hand parses that as two different characters and interprets the quotation mark as a closing attribute: this therefore allowed attackers to inject malicious HTML attributes and execute XSS attacks.

You can read more about it in the [security advisory](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit/security/advisories/GHSA-4hfh-fch3-5q7p).

Thanks to [bawolff](https://github.com/bawolff) for reporting this!
