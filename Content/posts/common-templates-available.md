# Commonly used templates available

Today we've made a few commonly used Vapor templates readily available for you to use. These templates are automatically generated from the [Vapor's template](https://github.com/vapor/template) so that they'll always be up-to-date.  
  
The templates can be found here:  
- [Bare template](https://github.com/vapor/template-bare)  
- [MySQL template](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-mysql)  
- [Postgres template](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-postgres)  
- [Postgres template with leaf](https://github.com/vapor/template-fluent-postgres-leaf)  

Happy coding!
